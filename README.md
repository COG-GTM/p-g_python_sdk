# Uid2 Client Python

Client SDK for working with UID2 services.

SDK supports Python 3.6 and above.

## Quick Start

Connect to the UID2 service, refresh encryption keys and use those to decrypt an advertising ID
from an advertising token:

```
from uid2_client import Uid2Client, decrypt_token

client = Uid2Client('https://prod.uidapi.com', 'my-auth-token')
keys = client.refresh_keys()
advertising_token = 'AgAAAANRdREk+IWqqnQkZ2rZdK0TgSUP/owLryysSkUGZJT+Gy551L1WJMAZA/G2B1UMDQ20WAqwwTu6o9TexWyux0lg0HHIbmJjN6IYwo+42KC8ugaR+PX0y18qQ+3yzkxmJ/ee//4IGu/1Yq4AmO4ArXN6CeszPTxByTkysVqyQVNY2A=='
decrypted_token = decrypt_token(advertising_token, keys)
print(decrypted_token.uid2)
```

More examples can be found in the [examples] directory.

## Development

Required for all subsequent commands, build docker image with Python 3.6 and all dev dependencies:

```
make docker
```

Run unit tests:

```
make test
```

Build a bdist wheel:

```
make wheel
```

Get access to interactive shell within the Python 3.6 docker image:

```
make shell
```

Run all the example applications:

```
make examples BASE_URL=https://prod.uidapi.com AUTH_KEY=my-auth-key \
	AD_TOKEN=AgAAAANRdREk+IWqqnQkZ2rZdK0TgSUP/owLryysSkUGZJT+Gy551L1WJMAZA/G2B1UMDQ20WAqwwTu6o9TexWyux0lg0HHIbmJjN6IYwo+42KC8ugaR+PX0y18qQ+3yzkxmJ/ee//4IGu/1Yq4AmO4ArXN6CeszPTxByTkysVqyQVNY2A==
```

Or specific examples:

```
make example_client BASE_URL=https://prod.uidapi.com AUTH_KEY=my-auth-key \
	AD_TOKEN=AgAAAANRdREk+IWqqnQkZ2rZdK0TgSUP/owLryysSkUGZJT+Gy551L1WJMAZA/G2B1UMDQ20WAqwwTu6o9TexWyux0lg0HHIbmJjN6IYwo+42KC8ugaR+PX0y18qQ+3yzkxmJ/ee//4IGu/1Yq4AmO4ArXN6CeszPTxByTkysVqyQVNY2A==
make example_auto_refresh BASE_URL=https://prod.uidapi.com AUTH_KEY=my-auth-key \
	AD_TOKEN=AgAAAANRdREk+IWqqnQkZ2rZdK0TgSUP/owLryysSkUGZJT+Gy551L1WJMAZA/G2B1UMDQ20WAqwwTu6o9TexWyux0lg0HHIbmJjN6IYwo+42KC8ugaR+PX0y18qQ+3yzkxmJ/ee//4IGu/1Yq4AmO4ArXN6CeszPTxByTkysVqyQVNY2A==
